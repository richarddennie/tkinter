# tkinter
Yoooooo, Fellow PROgrammers. I am not an expert, and I myself is still learning the mysteries of coding. 
Here this is for fellow beings like me. Here is the very very very... basic introduction for the famous "tkinter" module, Python.  Changes and comments are welcome. Thank You.

Tkinter is a standard library in python used for creating Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Desktop Applications. 
With the help of Tkinter developing desktop applications is a very easy task.

Prerequisites:
1) Some sort of Python knowledge.
2) That will do. 

Happy Coding.
